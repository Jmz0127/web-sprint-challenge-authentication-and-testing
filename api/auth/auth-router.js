        "id": 1,

    3- On FAILED registration due to `username` or `password` missing from the request body,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username and password required".

    4- On FAILED registration due to the `username` being taken,
      the response body should include a string exactly as follows: "username taken".
